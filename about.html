              <p>Our company provide services that inform, create security and provide
                 a result that all parties can feel satisfied with. Our ambition is to be present 
                 in as many places as possible and despite the fact that we are still a fairly small company, 
                 we work hard to achieve that goal. This also means that we want to ensure that the company stays 
                 up to date and constantly develops, hence we are also careful to work so that the environment is 
                 more in our development plan and that the development in it stays with us as it does with other things.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this is to stick to environmental considerations even though we 
                  are allowed to drive a lot to the various places in Sweden where our job and customers 
                  are. "Safety with thought from the inside out, prevention with the help of good planning, 
                  structure and a lot of knowledge." That's is how we look at our vision.</p>

          <h3><i class="fas fa-comments icon-about"></i> Consulting</h3>
          <p>A consultant is the one who follows construction 
            projects and keeps his eyes open for anything that 
            may be worth looking at that another may not have a 
            clue about. Did you know, for example, that if someone 
            were to be injured in the workplace (say your building), 
            it is you who bears the responsibility if safety has not 
            been ensured. We keep track of such details so that you 
            do not get into trouble if something should happen, and 
            we then also make sure that, like the example above, 
            accidents do not happen by following our protocols that 
            were designed to create a good working environment. However, 
            this is only a small part of what a consult does, the person 
            also makes sure that all the paperwork that must be signed is 
            available, that the construction goes according to the standard 
            that is said and must not be cheated with. The list can be longer,
             so you can generally say that the construction consultant is 
             the one who manages your project and leads it to a result with 
             a good standard.</p>
            <br>

          <h3><i class="fas fa-clipboard-list icon-about"></i> Guidance</h3>
          <p>When it comes to building, there are usually, 
            if not always, many questions that come up. We are 
            well aware of this and do everything in our power 
            to ensure that these questions can be answered as 
            quickly and clearly as possible. Sometimes the questions 
            are about more than what the individual himself can do and 
            then it is great to have us by his side, because we have a 
            part within the municipality that makes what requires more 
            out of the project such as paper production and so on is us 
            close at hand. In this way, our guidance makes your journey 
            in the project more smooth and perhaps even more relaxed 
            because we make sure that what needs to be done and provided 
            is always in place. With us, there is always the opportunity 
            to contact us on various forums such as email, phone, but 
            you can also book a meeting with us by sending an email with 
            this request. Regardless, we also make sure that three meetings 
            take place. This to make sure everything is right before, 
            during and after the project.</p>
             <br>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">          
          <h3><i class="fas fa-hands-helping icon-about"></i> Final</h3>
          <p>In the final step, we offer you an inspection that ensures 
            that the project is approved, has no possibility of water damage, 
            is handicapped accessible, straight floor without a boom 
            (which means that the floor is not uneven and can create 
            future damage to the building), has all papers available and 
            with an endorsement so that it can then be handed in to the 
            municipality and finally lead to the key ending up in your hand. 
            Of course, there are more points in this that can be underlined, 
            but for the different projects, different points may apply. Thus, 
            as we only mention a few general ones here to give a clear picture 
            of what a final description actually offers and does. Above all, 
            it ensures that the project is not left without everything being 
            ready and ready. In this way, customers will continue to save 
            money in the future by reducing the cost of repairs, which in 
            the long run may grow large. Therefore, we offer this final 
            stage so that the customer can be proud and feel good in their 
            construction for a long time to come. </p>
